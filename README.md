Portfolio_Projects
==================

1. Machine Learning Project - Price Prediction with LSTM | Python, Keras
[jupyter notebook][1]


In this project, I leveraged cutting-edge technologies like LSTM to create highly accurate short-term stock price predictions. By implementing LSTM models and predictive modeling techniques, I achieved precise forecasting, contributing to informed decision-making in financial markets. Additionally, I utilized seaborn for visually representing intricate stock price data, enhancing the interpretability of the predictions.

Key Highlights:

- Implementation of LSTM models for precise short-term stock price forecasts.
- Utilization of predictive modeling techniques to enhance accuracy.
- Visualization of stock price data using seaborn for clear insights.

2. SQL Data Exploration Project - Covid Data Analysis | SQL
[queries][2]


Through this project, I delved into COVID data, extracting invaluable insights to understand patterns related to fatalities across different countries. By applying SQL data analysis techniques, I identified crucial trends and factors contributing to the severity of the pandemic in various regions. This exploration led to the identification of the most significantly affected countries, offering valuable insights into the global impact of the pandemic.

Key Highlights:

- In-depth analysis of COVID data to uncover patterns in mortality rates.
- Identification of the most severely affected countries based on data analysis.

3. Tableau Dashboard Project - Amazon Prime Video Streaming Dashboard | Tableau 
[dashboard][3]


In this project, I designed an interactive Tableau dashboard aimed at comprehensively analyzing the distribution of Amazon Prime Video content across the globe. This dashboard provided a user-friendly interface for exploring and extracting information on the geographical distribution of content, enhancing understanding of the platform's global reach and content availability.

Key Highlights:

- Creation of an interactive dashboard for comprehensive analysis of Amazon Prime Video content distribution worldwide.
- User-friendly interface allowing for easy extraction of diverse data insights.
